# Abalone-Model
Part I uses linear regression to predict happiness for a given country using GDP.
Part II contains a linear regression model that reliably predicts the age of Abalone using Ordinary Least Squares.
The model takes input parameters of length, diameter, height, whole weight, shucked weight, viscera weight, shell weight.
The resulting model is overlayed on charts showing the relationship between age and each parameter
